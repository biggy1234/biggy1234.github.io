Sift confectioners'sugar and ground almonds in a seperate bowl and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes.</li>
				<li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag witha small corner cut off  and pipea test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet.
