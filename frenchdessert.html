				<li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</li>
				<li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until whites are foamy;beat in white sugar an continue beating until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks. Sift confectioners'sugar and ground almonds in a seperate bowl and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes.</li>
				<li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag witha small corner cut off  and pipea test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet. If the disk batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest.</li>
				<li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 285 degrees F(140 degrees C).</li>

			<h4>Ingrediants</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1 1/2(17.5 ounce) packages of frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>
				<li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
				<li>4 cups milk, divided</li>
				<li>1/3 cup of cake flour</li>
				<li>7/8 cup of white sugar, divided</li>
				<li>3 eggs, seperated</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
				<li>1(12 ounce)jar apricot jam</li>
				<li>3 cups of sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="background-content"><h4>Directions</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
				<li>Roll out three sheets of puff pastry, each to the same size and a thickness of 1/8 inch. Prick with a fork, and place on baking sheets.</li>
				<li>Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 10 minutes.</li>
				<li>In a medium bowl, combine cornstarch and 1/2 cup milk with fingers until smooth. Stir in cake flour and half the sugar. Beat in egg yolks. Set aside.</li>
				<li>In a saucepan over medium heat, bring remaining milk and remaining sugar to a rolling boil. Stir in egg yolk mixture; continue stirring and bring to a boil again. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla. Let cool.</li>
				<li>In a small saucepan or in the microwave, heat the jam until runny.</li>
				<li>Place one sheet of pastry on a board. Spread with cooled pastry cream to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Place a second pastry sheet over the cream. Brush with fruit glaze. Spread remaining pastry cream over glaze. Top with final pastry sheet and gently compress layers, using a baking sheet to press.</li>
				<li>To make icing, beat together confectioners' sugar and lemon juice with enough of the egg whites to make a creamy consistency like that of a cream soup. Working quickly, color a small portion of the frosting with red food coloring. Frost the top and sides of the assembled pastry with white icing. Pipe parallel lines of red icing on top of dessert, then draw a pick or knife crosswise through icing to make the traditional design. Let icing set before cutting into bars.
