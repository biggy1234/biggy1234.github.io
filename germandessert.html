		</div>
		<div class="background-content">
			<h4>Directions</h4>
			<ol>
				<h3>For the cake:</h3>
				<li>Lightly coat the insides of 3 9 by 1 1/2-inch cake pans with melted butter. Line each pan with parchment paper, then lightly coat the parchment paper with more melted butter. Set aside.</li>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place remaining butter and 8 ounces of semisweet chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap. Allow to heat for 10 to 12 minutes.Remove from the heat, stir until smooth, and hold at room temperature.</li>
				<li>Place the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of sugar in the bowl and beat on high for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
				<li>While the egg yolks are beating, whisk 4 egg whites in a large stainless steel bowl until stiff, but not dry, about 3 or 4 minutes.</li>
				<li>Using a rubber spatula, fold the melted choclate mixture into the beaten egg yolk mixture. Add a quarter of the beaten egg whites and stir to incorperate, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.</li>
				<li>Divide the batter  between the prepared pans, spreading evenly, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool inthe pans for 15 minutes.(During baking, the surface of the  cakes will form a crust; this crust will normally collapse when the cakes are removed from the oven.)Invert the cakes onto cake circles, remove the parchment paper, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
			</ol>
			<ol> 
				<h3>Filling:</h3>
				<li>To prepare the dark chocolate cream, heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat.</li>
				<li>Place the semisweet chocolate in the top half of the  doulbe boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap and allow to heat for 8 to 10 minutes.</li> 
				<li>Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer the melted chocolate to a stainless steel bowl and set aside until needed.</li> <li>Place heavy cream and sugar in the well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a well-chilled balloon whip.</li>
				<li>Whisk on high until stiff peaks form, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer.</li> 
				<li>Use a hand whisk to combine 1/4 of the whipped cream into the melted chocolate until smooth snd completely incorparted.</li> <li>Add the combined whipped cream and chocolate to the remaining whipped cream and use a rubber spatula to fold together.</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Ganache:</h3>
				<li>Heat the heavy cream and the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil.</li> <li>Place the semisweet chocolate in a 3-quart stainless steel bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes.</li> 
				<li>Stir until smooth. Remaining ganache should be at room temperature.</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Assembling the cake:</h3>
				<li>Arrange one of the cake layers in a 9-inch springform pan, evenly spread half the filling and top with the second layer.</li>
				<li>Add remaining filling and top with the remaining cake layer. Chill for 2 hours.</li> 
				<li>Transfer chilled cup of ganache to pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Remove cake from springform pan and coat sides and top with room temperature ganache.</li> <li>Using chilled ganache, decoratively pipe stars on top of the cake. If desired, coat sides of the cake with grated chocolate, cookie crumbs of chopped nuts.</li>

			<ol>
				<li>Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Spray the bottoms and sides of three 8-inch or two 9-inch round cake pans with the cooking spray. Cut three 8-inch or two 9-inch rounds of waxed paper or cooking parchment paper. Line bottoms of pans with the paper.</li>
				<li>Coarsely chop the chocolate. In a 1-quart saucepan, heat the chocolate and water over low heat, stirring frequently, until chocolate is completely melted; remove from heat and cool.</li>
				<li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir the flour, baking soda and salt until mixed; set aside. In another medium bowl, beat 2 cups sugar and 1 cup butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy; set aside.</li>
				<li>On medium speed, beat 1 egg yolk at a time into the sugar mixture until mixed. On low speed, beat in the melted chocolate and 1 teaspoon vanilla. On low speed, beat in 1/2 of the flour mixture just until smooth, then beat in 1/2 of the buttermilk just until smooth. Repeat beating in flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk just until smooth.
				</li>
				<li>Wash and dry mixer beaters. In a small bowl, beat the eggs whites on high speed until beaten eggs whites form stiff peaks when beaters are lifted. Add egg whites to the batter; to fold in, use a rubber spatula to cut down vertically through the batter, then slide the spatula across the bottom of the bowl and up the side, turning batter over. Rotate the bowl 1/4 turn, and repeat this down-across-up motion. Continue folding until batter and egg whites are blended.</li>
				<li>Pour batter into pans; use a rubber spatula to scrape batter from bowl, spread batter evenly in pans and smooth top of batter. (If batter is not divided evenly, spoon batter from one pan to another.) Refrigerate batter in third pan if not all pans will fit in oven at one time; bake third pan separately.</li>
				<li>Bake 8-inch pans 35 to 40 minutes, 9-inch pans 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
				<li>Cool cakes in pans 10 minutes. To remove cake from pan, invert onto cooling rack, then invert right side up on second cooling rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
				<li> In a 2-quart saucepan, stir the egg yolks, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, the evaporated milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla until well mixed. Cook over medium heat about 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until thick and bubbly. Stir in the coconut and pecans. Cool about 30 minutes, beating occasionally with a spoon, until mixture is spreadable.</li>
				<li>Place 1 cake layer, rounded side down, on a cake plate; using a metal spatula, spread 1/3 of the filling over the layer. Add second layer, rounded side down; spread with 1/3 of the filling. Add third layer, rounded side up; spread with remaining filling, leaving side of cake unfrosted. Store cake covered in the refrigerator.
