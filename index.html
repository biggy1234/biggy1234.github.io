			<h2> Biography on the Creater </h2>
			<p> Jamariea Simon </p>
			<p> She was born June 20, 2002 at Miami Valley Hospital. She has had the support of her 8th grade computer teacher (James Steward) to get her in a company called Sparkbox. A company that has taught her almost everything she needs to now about "coding a computer". But, when she has her free time she's at home cooking and she had the idea to make her own website (with the help of some friends at her job) about the different type's of foods and recipes from different places. </p>
